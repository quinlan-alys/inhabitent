#Inhabitent Wordpress Site

![alt tag](inhabitentshot.png)

##About

This is my first wordpress project. The website is designed for a mock retail outdoor company called "Inhabitent". The project uses many different page times from the wordpress hierarchy, as well as custom post types and fields. Working on this project presented a great opportunity to brush up on my sass, css, and php skills, and further my knowledge of working with wordpress. 

##Languages/Tools used:

- PHP
- Wordpress
- Gulp
- Javascript
- jQuery
- HTML
- Sass/CSS
